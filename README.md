# Portfolio Template

This folder provides a starting structure for your e-portfolio project.

## Folders

- `data/` – for datasets (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- `code/` – for your scripts or R Markdown files
- `outputs/` – for your charts, reports, or summaries
- `notes/` – for reflections or planning documents

To begin, open the sample R Markdown file in the `code/` folder.
